A number of variables need to be updated in snakebite when mgsv is updated.

Search for 'GAMEVERSION' and read the notes.

Roughly its:
Makebite:
GzsLib - qar flags
Build - MGSVVersionStr

Snakebite:
GzsLib - qar flags
SettingManager - static vars for dat hash, version, dat sizes
IsUpToDate isSpecialCase - manages whether older mod versions should be let through (for game updates where the dats didn't really change)

Making an installer build:
Snakebite uses NSIS create the installer:
https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download

The build process copies the required files to (SolutionDir)\installerbuild. 
Make sure you've done a release build then right click the snakebite.nsi in that folder and choose 'Compile NISI script'
