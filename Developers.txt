# Developing a new Snakebite/Makebite version

Work for a new version should be done on a seperate development branch than main.
Try and get some Modders Heaven community members to test build builds for you

## Updating for new game version
A number of variables need to be updated in snakebite when mgsv is updated.

Search for 'GAMEVERSION' and read the notes.

Roughly its:
Makebite:
GzsLib - qar flags
Build - MGSVVersionStr

Snakebite:
GzsLib - qar flags
SettingManager - static vars for dat hash, version, dat sizes
IsUpToDate isSpecialCase - manages whether older mod versions should be let through (for game updates where the dats didn't really change)

## Making an installer build:
Snakebite uses NSIS create the installer:
https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download

The Visual Studion post-build process should copy the required files to (SolutionDir)\installerbuild.
You can check the "Installer Sections" in Snakebite.nsi to double check the files needed, or just run snakebite.nsi and see if it errors.
Make sure you've done a release build then right click the snakebite.nsi in that folder and choose 'Compile NISI script'
